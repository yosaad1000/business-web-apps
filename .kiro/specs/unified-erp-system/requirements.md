# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for creating a unified ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system that integrates existing standalone applications (Employee Management System, Invoice App, Quiz Application, Indeed Clone, and CRUD Application) into a comprehensive business management platform. The system will feature enhanced UI/UX, Docker-based backend deployment, Supabase integration, and a centralized HRMS module as the core component.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business administrator, I want a unified dashboard that provides access to all ERP modules (HRMS, Invoice Management, Quiz Platform, Job Board, and General CRUD operations), so that I can manage all business operations from a single interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs into the system THEN the system SHALL display a unified dashboard with navigation to all modules
2. WHEN a user clicks on any module THEN the system SHALL navigate to that module while maintaining the unified navigation structure
3. WHEN a user is in any module THEN the system SHALL display a consistent header with module switcher and user profile options
4. IF a user lacks permissions for a module THEN the system SHALL hide that module from the navigation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an HR manager, I want an enhanced HRMS module that integrates employee data with other business functions, so that I can manage workforce information in context with invoices, training (quizzes), and recruitment (job board).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing employee records THEN the system SHALL display related invoices, completed training modules, and job applications
2. WHEN creating an employee record THEN the system SHALL allow assignment to departments, roles, and access permissions for other modules
3. WHEN an employee completes a quiz THEN the system SHALL automatically update their training records in HRMS
4. IF an employee is involved in invoice processing THEN the system SHALL track their invoice-related activities in their profile

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a finance manager, I want the invoice management system to integrate with employee data and vendor information, so that I can track invoice approvals, assignments, and financial workflows efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating an invoice THEN the system SHALL allow assignment to specific employees for processing and approval
2. WHEN an invoice requires approval THEN the system SHALL route it to the appropriate manager based on employee hierarchy
3. WHEN viewing invoice reports THEN the system SHALL display employee involvement and approval chains
4. IF an invoice is overdue THEN the system SHALL notify assigned employees and their managers

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a training coordinator, I want the quiz platform to integrate with HRMS data, so that I can assign training modules to employees and track their progress as part of their professional development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a quiz THEN the system SHALL allow assignment to specific employees, departments, or roles
2. WHEN an employee completes a quiz THEN the system SHALL automatically update their training records and notify their manager
3. WHEN viewing training reports THEN the system SHALL display completion rates by department and individual progress
4. IF mandatory training is overdue THEN the system SHALL send notifications to employees and managers

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an HR recruiter, I want the job board functionality to integrate with the HRMS system, so that I can manage job postings, applications, and candidate progression through the hiring pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a job application is received THEN the system SHALL create a candidate profile linked to the specific job posting
2. WHEN a candidate is hired THEN the system SHALL automatically create an employee record with relevant information transferred
3. WHEN viewing recruitment metrics THEN the system SHALL display hiring pipeline status and time-to-hire analytics
4. IF a position is filled THEN the system SHALL automatically close the job posting and notify relevant stakeholders

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the entire ERP system to run on Docker with Supabase backend integration, so that I can ensure scalable, maintainable, and cloud-ready deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the system THEN all backend services SHALL run in Docker containers with proper orchestration
2. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL connect to Supabase for database operations and authentication
3. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling through Docker container replication
4. IF database migrations are required THEN the system SHALL handle them automatically during deployment

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an end user, I want an enhanced, intuitive UI that provides consistent experience across all modules, so that I can efficiently navigate and use different parts of the ERP system without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using any module THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent design patterns, colors, and navigation elements
2. WHEN performing similar actions across modules THEN the system SHALL use consistent UI components and workflows
3. WHEN the interface loads THEN it SHALL be responsive and work seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
4. IF a user needs help THEN the system SHALL provide contextual help and tooltips for complex features

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want role-based access control across all ERP modules, so that I can ensure employees only access information and functions relevant to their responsibilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL authenticate them and load their role-based permissions
2. WHEN accessing any module THEN the system SHALL enforce permissions and hide unauthorized features
3. WHEN user roles change THEN the system SHALL update their access permissions across all modules immediately
4. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL log the attempt and deny access with appropriate messaging

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want integrated reporting and analytics across all ERP modules, so that I can generate comprehensive business insights and cross-functional reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL allow data combination from multiple modules (HRMS, invoices, training, recruitment)
2. WHEN viewing dashboards THEN the system SHALL display key performance indicators from all business areas
3. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL support multiple formats (PDF, Excel, CSV) with proper formatting
4. IF real-time data is needed THEN the system SHALL provide live dashboard updates and notifications

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the ERP system to maintain existing .env configuration from the invoice app while extending it for the unified system, so that I can preserve current settings and ensure smooth migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the unified system THEN it SHALL use the existing invoice app .env file as the base configuration
2. WHEN new modules are added THEN the system SHALL extend the configuration without breaking existing settings
3. WHEN environment variables are updated THEN all modules SHALL reflect the changes without requiring individual restarts
4. IF configuration conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and resolution guidance
