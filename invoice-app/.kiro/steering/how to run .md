   Add Rules to this file or a short description and have Kiro refine them for you:   

   DEPLOYMENT RULE: The agent must run using Docker containers only. No local development 
   environment should be set up except for the React frontend which can run locally for 
   development purposes. All backend services, databases, and other components must be 
   containerized and orchestrated through Docker/Docker Compose.
